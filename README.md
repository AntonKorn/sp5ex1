1. 

We see both a response and a request header.

These headers show request Method, status code, how to site is cached and much more.

I simply get a 200 status code when trying to access my html page.

2

My image is shown and works fine with a 200 status.

But I don't have an external style sheet available so that gives me a 400 code.

3.

First I get a 301 status code on the http site. This status code show that I am redirected to another site.
I then end up at the secure connection https. This site shows me 200 status code as I am now on the proper secure site.

5.

When trying to use a get method for getting the names. We can see that it is posted in the url. 
However when it is changed to post that info is suddenly hidden and replaced with a '#'.

6.
Because we now have a session in the browser. It can recognize that I have visited the server again
during the same session. Therefore I can see access my data as long as the session is open.

7.
When adding a local cookie. That is stored in the browser I can now see and expiration date to the cookie. 
This cookie can last for as long as I desire, when i create the cookie object in java. Following the nescessary laws
regarding cookies of course.
